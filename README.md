# Tic-Tac-Toe Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.4.15
- GVR Unity SDK v1.170.0

### GVR SDK for Unity
- `GoogleVR` > `Demos` is not included.
- `GoogleVR` > `GVRVideoPlayer.unitypackage` is included.
- The `Max Reticle Distance` value for the `GvrReticlePointer` used in the scene is set to `20` instead of the default `10`.
- Scripts applicable to the course have been updated to reflect Unity's API change from `UnityEngine.VR` to `UnityEngine.XR`.

>**Note:** If for any reason you remove and re-import GVR SDK for Unity v1.170.0, make sure you accept any API update pop-up prompts triggered by Unity. Alternatively, you can manually run the API updater (Unity menu `Assets` > `Run API Updater...`) after the import has completed.
